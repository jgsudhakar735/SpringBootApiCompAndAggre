## API Composition and Aggregation
        It can involve merging data from multiple microservices into a single, cohesive response. 
        This is particularly useful in the microservice architecture where the different services handle the 
        different parts of the business process. By the aggregating the responses from these services at the gateway level, 
        we can reduce the number of the client-side requests, streamline data retrieval and improve the performance.
